# Feature stages

Some Coder features are released in feature stages before they are generally
available.

For more information about a specific feature, please contact _X_.

## Alpha features

Alpha features are enabled in all Coder deployments but the feature is subject
to change, or even be removed. Breaking changes may not be documented in the
changelog. In most cases, features will only stay in alpha for 1 month.

We recommend using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/coder/coder/issues) to
leave feedback and get support for alpha features.

## Early access (EA) features

Early access features are neither feature-complete nor stable. We do not
recommend using EA features in production deployments.

Coder releases EA features behind an “unsafe” experiment, where they’re
accessible but not easy to find.

### Early access support expectation

Support for early access features is available through _X_.

## Experimental features

These features are disabled by default, and not recommended for use in
production as they may cause performance or stability issues. In most cases,
experimental features are complete, but require further internal testing and
will only stay in the experimental stage for one or two weeks.

Coder may make significant changes to experiments or revert features to a
feature flag at any time.

If you plan to activate an experimental feature, we suggest that you use a
staging deployment.

You can opt-out of an experiment after you've enabled it.

```yaml
# Enable all experimental features
coder server --experiments=*

# Enable multiple experimental features
coder server --experiments=feature1,feature2

# Alternatively, use the `CODER_EXPERIMENTS` environment variable.
```

### Experimental features support expectation

Support for experimental features is available through _X_.

They’re subject to minor changes and may contain bugs, but are generally ready
for use.
